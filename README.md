# CODSOFT Data Science Internship
Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at CODSOFT. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

## INTRODUCTION:
I am thrilled to share my journey during the CODSOFT Data Science Internship, where I had the opportunity to work on any three of five exciting projects/tasks that delved into different aspects of data science. This internship has been an invaluable learning experience, and I am excited to showcase the results of my hard work. Below are the tasks given by CODSOFT during this internship journey:

## DATA SCIENCE TASKS:
1. TASK 1: Insights-Driven_sales
PURPOSE: to analyze sales transactions and derive actionable insights that can enhance sales strategies. Specifically, the dataset contains information about customers, their demographics, purchase behaviors, and transaction details.

2. TASK 2: STOCK PREDICTION
PURPOSE: TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE OF A COMPANY USING LSTM.

3. TASK 3: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
PURPOSE: Predict sales based on advertising expenditure using the given dataset. The dataset contains information about advertising
spending on different platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding sales amount.


4. TASK 4: Stock_Market_Prediction_Model_Creation
PURPOSE: to develop a model for analyzing and predicting stock market trends.


5. TASK 5: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
PURPOSE: Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

# CONCLUSION:
The project details and conclusions could indeed be tailored to reflect Hackveda Limited's contributions and objectives. Here's how you could frame it:

1. Insights-Driven Sales: By leveraging Hackveda Limited's expertise in data analysis, the project identified the most profitable customer segment—married women aged 26–35 working in IT, healthcare, or aviation, residing in UP, Maharashtra, or Karnataka, and purchasing food, clothing, or electronics. This analysis enables smarter decision-making and sales optimization.

2. Stock Prediction Using LSTM: Hackveda's implementation of LSTM models accurately forecasted Google stock trends over a 100-day window, providing actionable insights for investors.

3. Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression: The project demonstrated Hackveda's capability to predict future sales effectively by analyzing correlations like TV ad spend and sales performance.

4. Fraud Detection: Hackveda's focus on anomaly detection using logistic regression laid the groundwork for identifying fraudulent transactions with ~93% accuracy.

###Hackveda Limited's pivotal role in executing data-driven solutions for market analysis, predictive modeling, and fraud prevention.
